## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}

```

```{r,message=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")


library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)



comparison <- contributions %>%
  full_join(candidates,by = "cand_id")
comparison
comparison %>% 
  select(cand_id,cand_ici, entity_type)

```


join candidates with contributions by cand_id
compare cand_ici with entity_type
we want to see where the money is coming from for challengers vs incumbents vs open seats CAN = Candidate
CCM = Candidate Committee
COM = Committee
IND = Individual (a person)
ORG = Organization (not a committee and not a person)
PAC = Political Action Committee
PTY = Party Organization
